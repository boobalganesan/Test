Adam: Hi, guys. Great to have you with us today. Let's start with some background information. Joby Aviation, Inc. Is a vertically integrated air mobility company, and they're in the process of building an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft optimized for air transportation. They've just released their financial results for the second quarter of 2021, and they were up over 90% year-over-year. However, let's make sure we understand the company's financials a little better.

Miley: Absolutely. Joby Aviation, Inc. Sold 219 vehicles in the second quarter, bringing their total deliveries to 438 so far this year. They also had 1,128 flights, which is 43% more than what they had in the first quarter. Their revenue is growing at a robust rate of 1,350% year-over-year.

John: And they also generated net income of $8.4 million, which is a great showing. What's truly exciting about Joby is that they're on a trajectory to generate net income of $15 million by year one, and their adjusted EBITDA is over 70%.

Jacob: That's incredible! I hope I'll be able to ride in one of their planes in the future.

Adam: Well, let's talk about the future then. Joby is making tremendous progress towards their goal of providing air transportation services as a service. They're working with Alphabet's Google X to develop an application-based platform that will enable consumers to book rides through their devices. This platform will make it easier for people to access affordable transportation without having to rely on traditional car rental companies.

Miley: That's so exciting! The potential for Joby to provide a sustainable and convenient mode of transportation is truly remarkable.

John: I also want to mention that Joby's board recently approved a $250 million share repurchase plan. This shows their confidence in the company's growth prospects and their commitment to building shareholder value.

Jacob: I would also like to know more about the partnerships that Joby has formed. For instance, they've partnered with Virgin Atlantic, a British airline, to develop and commercialize electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. This partnership will enable Joby to share their technology with Virgin Atlantic's customers while also growing Joby's market share in the UK and the European market.

Adam: Great! And speaking of partnerships, Joby has also announced that they're partnering with Airbus to create the first all-electric regional marketplace in Europe. This partnership will help Joby to access a wider market and offer more convenient transportation options across Europe.

Miley: That's really exciting! Joby has a lot of good partnerships on their hands, and I'm particularly impressed with the ones with Virgin Atlantic and Airbus. They're showing that they're a real force in the air mobility space by expanding their product line and partnering with other companies.

John: That's a great point, Miley. Joby has proven to be not only a powerful technological innovator but also has the ability to create partnerships and alliances that drive growth and shareholder value.

Jacob: And last but not least, Joby is working on initiatives to develop clean energy technologies for their aircraft, which will help them to become more sustainable and environment-friendly.

Adam: That's a great point, Jacob. Clean energy technologies are key to Joby's sustainability strategy. By deploying these technologies, they're able to reduce overall emissions by up to 90%.

Miley: I couldn't agree more, Joby has shown that they can be a leader in sustainable and environmentally conscious transportation. And their technology is already being used to transform the aviation industry, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this company.

John: Absolutely. Joby is an exciting company that's on the verge of disrupting the air mobility space, and its ability to innovate and provide affordable and sustainable transportation options is truly remarkable.

Jacob: And let's not forget their commitment to humanitarian and sustainability initiatives through their partnerships.

Adam: Exactly! Joby is making a positive impact in both the economic, environmental, and social aspects of life. Their dedication to these issues sets them apart from their competitors.

Miley: I couldn't agree more, it's refreshing to see a company that's also focused on the wellbeing and safety of all its customers and partners. It's truly inspiring to hear about such a promising company, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for Joby Aviation, Inc.

John: And finally, in closing, I encourage everyone to invest in this exciting company. Joby Aviation, Inc. Is on the right path to becoming a leader in the air mobility space. Its robust financials, innovative technology, and commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility make it a standout company in a crowded market.

Jacob: And let me just say one last thing about Joby Aviation, Inc. Investors should also consider its ability to expand its customer base, especially in the United States and Dubai. The combination of its vertical takeoff and landing capabilities together with the recent partnership with Virgin Atlantic to develop electric regional marketplaces creates a strong opportunity for growth in these markets.
