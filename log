Adam: Good morning, everyone! We have some interesting updates for our discussion today. Wells Fargo & Company just released its recent financial results, and there's quite a lot to discuss.

Miley: Good afternoon! According to the press release, Wells Fargo has experienced a decline in its total assets to $395 billion as of the end of Q4 2018. However, the company expects its full-year 2018 net income to grow to $10.5 billion from $8.2 billion last year due to increased equity and the strong capital base.

John: That's impressive, Miley. Wells Fargo has always been strong in its capital provisioning, so it's good to hear that the company is seeing positive results. What impact do asset levels have on net income?

Miley: The positive impact on net income is due to the fact that Wells Fargo has a strong capital base. If we're seeing asset levels decline, then that means the company's capital is being impacted negatively, which can affect net income.

John: I see. And what percentage of assets does Wells Fargo have?

Miley: As of the end of Q4 2018, Wells Fargo had just under 3% of total assets held by deposits, with the balance held in other assets.

Jacob: That sounds like a manageable percentage.

John: Yes, I definitely think so. Wells Fargo has been increasing its share of revenue through a variety of products, and as a result, its share of total assets has been growing.

Adam: That's absolutely correct. Wells Fargo has been aggressively expanding its portfolio over the past few years, and as a result, it has seen a significant increase in its investment portfolio. This has helped contribute to the company's increased assets.

Miley: Exactly, Jacob. Wells Fargo's assets grew by a whopping 49% from last year.

Jacob: I can't believe it. Wells Fargo is on the rise.

Miley: Yes, they definitely are.

Jacob: And let's talk about Wells Fargo's profitability. How has their operating expenses been impacted, John?

John: I'll have to get into that one. Wells Fargo has experienced a decline in their operating expenses due to a combination of factors. Firstly, the company has been investing in new technology to improve its efficiency, such as AI and automation.

Adam: Absolutely, that's right. They are also utilizing technology to streamline their processes, resulting in cost savings.

Jacob: That's fascinating, John. Wells Fargo is investing in technology to reduce their operating expenses.

Miley: Exactly! The company's focus on technology and efficiency is paying off in the form of cost savings.

John: I agree. Their Q4 EPS was $1.16, which was slightly below the consensus estimate of $1.21, and their full-year EPS estimate of $5.27 is well above the market's consensus estimate of $4.88. How do we think Wells Fargo is able to maintain its impressive financial results despite the challenges of high-interest rates?

Adam: That's a great question, John. Wells Fargo has always prioritized credit quality over growth, which has been a key factor in their success. Instead of chasing investment opportunities, they have put their focus on maintaining high credit quality in their portfolio. This has helped them to maintain a stable capital base and low asset turnover, which has allowed for improved profitability.

John: And speaking of credit quality, Wells Fargo has consistently increased the average credit score of its consumers. This has helped to improve the company's ability to originate new loans.

Miley: Yes, it's been good for Wells Fargo. Their lending efforts have allowed them to make more loans and increase their total assets while still maintaining a good credit quality.

John: And let's not forget about Wells Fargo's reputation. The company has maintained its stellar reputation with its customers and has built a strong financial institution.

Miley: That's true. Wells Fargo's strong financial position has also helped to stabilize its stock price.

Adam: Yes, that's exactly what happened. Wells Fargo's shares plunged dramatically in 2018 after reporting disappointing quarterly earnings. However, following their recent financial release, Wells Fargo's stock quickly rebounded.

Jacob: And let's not forget about the company's commitment to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance).

Miley: Absolutely, John. Wells Fargo has strongly committed to the ESG space, which is a testament to their commitment to transparency and sustainability.

John: That's absolutely right, Miley. Wells Fargo's growth has not come without its challenges, but their efforts to increase their focus on ESG and operational efficiency have yield some impressive results.

Adam: And finally, let's talk about Wells Fargo's impact on the industry. As a financial institution, we believe that Wells Fargo's success is ultimately beneficial to the industry as a whole.

John: You're right, Adam. Wells Fargo has indeed been a major player in the banking and investment industry.

Jacob: And let's not forget the growth potential Wells Fargo has demonstrated. The company's success story has been significant and speaks to the strengths and capabilities of their leadership team.

Miley: Definitely true, Jacob. Wells Fargo has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the industry and has been a major contributor to it in recent years.

Adam: Their sustainable growth model has been impactful, and I think they are well positioned to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders.

John: And let's not forget their emphasis on technology. Wells Fargo has been leading the way in terms of adopting new technologies and redefining the banking experience.

Miley: Yes, they're showing great leadership in this regard. I expect to see continued progress and innovation in their technology areas.

Adam: Good morning, everyone! So, let's start with some updates on Oklo Inc. Stock. Recently, the company announced their results for the third quarter 2021. According to the press release, the company posted revenues of $0.7 million for the quarter, down significantly from $1.3 million in the same quarter last year. The company attributed the decrease to the impact of the global energy crisis on nuclear power demand and increased research and development costs related to the company's nuclear fuel recycling services.

Miley: I see. So, the results were a bit down from last year's. What did the CEO say about it?

John: Yeah. The CEO mentioned that the company is continuing to invest in its technology in advance of the next generation of nuclear reactors, and that the company is focusing on research and development to reduce costs and improve efficiency. That sounds quite promising.

Jacob: Makes sense. I've heard a lot about fuel recycling services recently. Isn't that part of the company's business?

Adam: Yes, that's correct. The company provides used nuclear fuel recycling services as part of its long-term business strategy. This reduces the dependency on critical nuclear material and contributes to reducing the dependence on foreign natural gas supplies.

Miley: Cool. So, what were the highlights from the quarter?

John: The company reported a net loss of $4.5 million during the quarter, compared to a net loss of $3.8 million in the same quarter last year. The reason for the sharp increase in the loss was increased research and development costs related to the company's nuclear fuel recycling services.

Jacob: I see. That's not ideal. But overall, it sounds like the company is on track with its long-term strategies.

Adam: That's exactly right. It remains to be seen how the global energy crisis will impact the company's financials this year as a whole. But, so far, they're making progress in their plans to become a leader in the nuclear fuel recycling space.

Miley: It seems like the market's been bullish on the company's shares. Is that because of the recent results or the news about oil prices?

John: It's likely a combination of both. After a couple of rough quarters in 2020, the broader market has been focused on the short-term prospects for crude prices, as well as stimulus packages from governments to stimulate the economy during challenging times. We believe that's a good sign for the company's long-term business prospects because it improves the company's access to capital markets and provides more opportunities for growth.

Jacob: Sounds good. Let's move on to the latest on the company's business operations.

Adam: Since our last meeting, the company has taken several steps to reduce costs, including:

- Cutting costs in research and development by 15% over the past year.
- Implementing a new vendor management system to improve communication and reduce contractual risk.
- Streamlining the company's operations by reducing headcount by 25%.

Miley: That's great to hear. What about the company's progress on its project to build a large-scale nuclear plant in Texas? Have they made any updates on that?

John: Yes, the project is progressing well, with the company expecting to receive a USD 1 billion contract award soon. This contract will enable the company to secure the technical and financial support necessary to advance the project to the next stage.

Jacob: That's great news. I'm excited to see the results of the project and how Oklo is able to realize its long-term goals.

Adam: Yeah, we're also watching the project closely as it can be a game-changer for Oklo. The company believes that building large-scale nuclear facilities in Texas will help them gain long-term access to the same quality natural gas that they rely on today, thus reducing the dependence on foreign natural gas supplies.

Miley: Sounds interesting. What next for Oklo on the financial front? Any new projects in the works?

John: Yes, the company is focused on continuing to optimize its balance sheet, with a goal of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. The company will return approximately USD 10 million in cash this year from operations.

Jacob: I've seen the company's financial results for this quarter and it looks solid. They're on track to have a healthy cash position and return capital to shareholders.

Adam: That's right. Overall, the company continues to deliver on its strategic goals and has an impressive track record of profitability.

Miley: That's impressive. I'm curious about the company's plans for the future. Have they set any new goals or targets for themselves?

John: Yes, the company is currently working on several initiatives to improve its operational efficiency, which include:

- Developing next-generation nuclear reactors that use significantly less water and produce less heat.
- Expanding the company's business into international markets.
- Improving project management and reducing contract risk.

Jacob: That's promising. Oklo's investors and customers should be excited to see the company's continued progress and growth.

Adam: Absolutely. The company has done an excellent job so far in achieving its goals and has shown a strong commitment to its long-term business strategy.

Miley: Yes, it's great to see a company that is focused on sustainability and profitability. It sets a good example for others in the industry.

John: Yes, I completely agree. The company has a clear goal of becoming a leader in the nuclear fuel recycling space and a trusted partner to its customers. It's an exciting time for the company, and the results of the quarter suggest that they're on track to achieve their long-term goals.

Jacob: I couldn't agree more. Congratulations to the team at Oklo for all their hard work and dedication.

Adam: Thank you, everyone. It's been great to hear your insights on the company and its progress. We'll have to keep an eye out for any new developments that could shape the company's future. Until next time, have a great day!
